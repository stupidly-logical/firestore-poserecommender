With Google Cloud Firestore, we can develop rich mobile, web and IoT applications using a fully managed, scalable, and serverless No-SQL document database that horizontally scales to meet any demand, with no maintenance. Some of my favorite features of Firestore besides the fact that it is fully managed, serverless and effortlessly auto scales up or down to meet any demand with no maintenance windows or downtime are that it has
Built-in live synchronization and offline mode makes it easy to build multi-user, collaborative applications
Powerful query engine that allows you to run ACID compliant transactions whilst providing flexibility in structure for your data
High availability of 99.99–99.999% achieved through strongly consistent data replication
Lets you pay only for what you use, no up-front expenditure or underutilized resources
Simplified architecture lets your apps talk directly to Firestore from your mobile or web clients
